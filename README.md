The VS Code Tool that helps developers develop faster.


### [Download for Windows](https://hcpipomawpcqsalbnegl.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/Personal/Make%20a%20File%20(VS%20Code%20Tool)%20(1).exe?download=)

```
Please note that your browser might flag the exe because it is
using the subproccess extenstion. I can assure you it is 
completely safe and if you want to you can compile it yourself 
or use the .py file.
```

## HOW TO USE
Firstly, you can either download the compiled version or use the raw .py file. After downloading it place it in the folder where you want your created files to be placed. After this you can add a desktop shortcut to access it easily.

The UI is pretty self explanatory, in the first text box you will insert your folder/project name. In the second text box, you will name your first file (e.g. main.lua, index.html, app.py, etc.)

And that's it!
