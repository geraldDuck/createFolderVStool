[!] NOTICE:
After hating myself for a week, I decided
to actually fix this sh**ty project. What
started as a UI tool is now simply a command
line interface.
(cuz f**k you and I'm too lazy)
(P.S. I censored the cuss words (yippe!!))
``` 

## HOW TO USE
Firstly, you need to download the thing, do that up there. Then put the file on
your Desktop. You can open it in your IDLE to change the path.

And that's it!
